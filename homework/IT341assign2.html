        <p>Juniata College class of 2021, computer science major, interested in web developing.</p>
        <h2>Rationale or focus</h2>
        <p>This website is a personal interests website or an academic practicing. In this website, there will be a collection of some galleries, music, poetry or stories. Also, it will support users to upload their own artworks through login. </p>
        <h2>Main feature</h2>
        <p>The main elements of this website will include slideshows, music players, text readers and some transitioning animation. All the styles of this website will keep similar and as clean as possible.</p>
        <h2>Content</h2>
        <p>This website will include a main page, which has 4 secondary selections: images (also drawings), stories, music and poetry. Under images there will be a galleries page, and each of the gallery has a slideshow. Under music there will be a page including music player and music list. Under the stories and poetry there will be only one page including text reader and the list in each one. In addition, there will be a login page and a personal account page. </p>
        <p>Totally, assume there will be x galleries, the total page should be: 1 main page + 4 secondary page + 2 login page + x galleris = 7+x pages</p>
        <h2>Target audience</h2>
        <p>The target audience might be the people who is interested in watching Japanese anime, drawing, music listening, poetry reading or novel reading. Also, everyone who is creative can upload their artworks into the website and receive points.The style of the content will be inclusive but mainly in Japanese style. All of the text will use English, unless it has different language version.</p>
        <h2>Design considerations</h2>
        <p>The design goals is to make this website looks pretty and clean, and have the author's own style. No redundent part or any bugs will occur.</p>
        <h2>Limiting factors</h2>
        <p>The biggest limitation might be opening the server and attract users. Opening a server needs money and it is hard to attract many users if this website is for a minor interest. This can be a both technology or audience problem. However, this is an academic practice, fake users can be provided by the author. </p>
