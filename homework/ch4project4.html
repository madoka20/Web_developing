<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets offer many benefits to web designers. <em class="emphasis">CSS lets you separate style information from HTML</em>, allowing you to provide style sheets for different destination media as your web site requires. You can control the display characteristics of an entire web site with a single style sheet, making maintenance and enhancements of display information a less taxing chore. You can express a wide range of style properties that increase the legibility, accessibility, and delivery of your content. You can build page layouts, either flexible, fixed, or responsive to suit your user and content needs. As you will see in this chapter and through the rest of the book, CSS is easy to learn and apply to your web design projects.</p>
