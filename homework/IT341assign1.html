		This project will be an individual project. It is not for an outside client but an academic exercise. 
	</p>

	<p class="content">
		My idea of this project is to build a set of websites that collects my favorite music, drawing, poems, lyrics or novels. This website will not use for commercial. In these websites, I will include some animation and aesthetic elements to make it good at the appearance and also bulid some useful functions.
